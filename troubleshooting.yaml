Basics:
    When adding Rythm I can't see my server on the list: |
        <br/> You need to have a role with “<b>Administrator</b>” or “<b>Manage server</b>” permissions to be able to add a Bot (Rythm) to a <b>Discord Server</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> If you have the right permissions and <b>still can’t see</b> your server in the list, make sure you’re <b>logged in</b> into the correct <b>discord account</b> in your <b>web browser</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Note</b>: If that still didn't work, We suggest trying a <b>different browser</b> to invite Rythm to your server. <b>(Incognito Mode will not work.)</b>
    Rythm left the voice channel while not playing anything: |
        <br/> For performance reasons, Rythm leaves after a while of being alone or unused in a voice channel.
        <br/> This helps Rythm save resources while no one is listening to it and keeps the music quality consistent for all users at any given time!
        <br/>
        <br/> Don't worry though, as long as you are in a voice channel, just type <b>!summon</b> to make Rythm join your channel!
    Rythm forgets the playlist I queued after it leaves: |
        <br/> For performance reasons, Rythm will clear/reset the queue when it leaves the voice channel.
        <br/> To get around this we suggest creating a Youtube playlist of the songs you wish to re-queue.
    Rythm messages come out blank: |
        <br/> Rythm uses something called rich embeds for the messages, which is an option that <b>might be disabled</b> on your client. Make sure to <b>enable</b> it!
        <br/>
        <br/> To do so:
        <br/>
        <br/> Go to your <b>discord settings</b> > click on "<b>Text & Images</b>" > <b>Enable</b> "Show website preview info from links pasted into chat”.
        <br/>
        <br/> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/dvmYgs9.png" alt="" style="width:500px;height:330px;" />
    Rythm does not respond to commands: |
        <br/> If Rythm isn’t responding to commands, try the following:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>1.</b> <b>Ensure you’re using the correct prefix</b>. You can see the current prefix for Rythm by Mentioning the bot. <u>Example</u>: <b>@Rythm#3722</b> or <b><@235088799074484224> </b>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>2.</b> <b>Ensure Rythm has permissions to send messages in the text channel.</b>
        <br/> You can give “<b>Administrator</b>” permissions to the bot to make this easier.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>3.</b> Check the #outages section of the Rythm bot Discord server to see if there is an outage
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>4.</b> If the above methods do not work send your server ID to one of the members of the support team like so:
        <br/> - enable developer mode as shown below <code>(User Settings -> Appearance -> Developer Mode)</code>
        <br/> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/nAIWAPa.png"/>
        <br/> - Right-click on your server name at the top left and select <code>Copy ID</code>
        <br/> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/CxXP2Ch.png"/>
    How can I reset Rythm's prefix: |
        <br/> If you have changed the default Rythm prefix to a custom one and now can’t make Rythm work or aren’t able to change the prefix back, do the following:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>1.</b> <u>Mention the bot.</u>
        <br/>
        <br/> You can do this by typing: <b>@Rythm#3722 </b> or <b><@235088799074484224> </b>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>Note</b>: Mentioning the bot won’t work if the channel you used is <b>Blacklisted</b>.
        <br/> When you mention the bot, do it in a channel the bot can read in.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>2.</b> <u>Copy the Prefix response </u>.
        <br/>
        <br/> After mentioning Rythm, it should give you a message similar to this:
        <br/>
        <br/> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/JLpuLHX.png" alt="" style="width:573px;height:150px;" >
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>You must Copy the part that is marked in red</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>3.</b> <u>Run the prefix command.</u>
        <br/>
        <br/> Paste the copied text in the chat box and <b>right next to it</b> with <b>no spaces</b> type: settings prefix ! <br/> <br/> <u>Example</u>: To set the prefix back to <b>!</b> in the above picture, the command would be this:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>;2Test-)29dsettings prefix ! </b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> Note: You must have a role with “Administrator” or “Manage Server” permissions to be able to change Rythm’s prefix.
    Rythm is responding to commands but not joining voice channel: |
        <br/> If you find that Rythm is responding to your commands but not joining a voice channel use the following method:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>1.</b> Move to a different voice channel.
        <br/> <b>2.</b> <b>!summon</b> the bot into that voice channel.
        <br/> <b>3.</b> Move back to the original voice channel.
        <br/> <b>4.</b> <b>!summon</b> the bot back into the original voice channel.
        <br/>
        <br/> If the above method does not work:
        <br/> Try changing server region or kicking and re-adding Rythm from the discord server.
        <br/>
        <br/> This problem can exist due to multiple issues, mostly Discord API lagging.
Sound issues:
    Rythm is lagging: |
        <br/> If you find that Rythm's sound has started to lag, perform the following checks in order:
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>1.</b> Kick Rythm out of the voice channel and resummon him using the commands <b>!dc</b> and then <b>!summon</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>2.</b> Go to <b>server settings</b> and change the server region a few times until you find a server where Rythm does not lag.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>3.</b> Check the Rythm Bot Discord Guild by typing <b>!invite</b> and selecting the <b>Official Discord</b> option and checking the #outages channel to see if Rythm is currently having an issue with lagging.

        <br/>
        <br/> <b>2.</b> Ensure that Rythm's volume is not set to 0, if you right click on Rythm while it is in a music channel <b>ensure the slider in red is not set to 0</b>:

        <br/> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/omXLR57.png">
        <br/> <b>N.B: For donators:</b> use the <b>!vol</b> command to check that the server's volume has not been set to 0.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>3.</b> <b>Disconnect</b> from the voice channel and <b>Reconnect</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>4.</b> Check the Rythm Bot Discord Guild by typing <b>!invite</b> and selecting the <b>Official Discord</b> option and checking the #outages channel to see if Rythm is currently having an issue with not playing music.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>5.</b> Check your output options in Discord settings.
        <br/> User settings --> Voice --> Output Device and Output Volume
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>6.</b> Check your computer's system volume.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>7.</b> Try reconnecting Rythm to your voice channel using the <b>!dc</b> and <b>!summon</b> commands.
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>8.</b> Try changing your Discord server's region a few times until you find a server where Rythm plays music.
        <br/> Server settings --> Overview --> Server Region
        <br/>
        <br/> <b>9.</b> Ensure that the music is not paused. You can check this by using <b>!pause</b>. If the bot replies with <code>The player is already paused</code>, use <b>!resume</b> to start the music again.
Mobile:
    Rythm keeps muting itself: |
        <br/> If you are on mobile and find that Rythm keeps muting itself after each song
        <br/>
        <br/> This is a problem with Discord on mobile and the only found way to fix it is to uninstall and reinstall Discord.
    The screen to add Rythm to my server is gray and empty: |
        <br/> If you are on mobile and you find that you cannot add Rythm due to the fact that the link to add Rythm produces a gray screen please try first heading to <a href="https://discordapp.com/login">https://discordapp.com/login</a>, logging in and then using the invite link again.
        <br/> If that does not work, we recommend using a desktop device to invite Rythm.
        <br/>
        <br/> In short: You may want to try refreshing the website to add Rythm or use a desktop device.
